This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl programming: accessing an array element using an index that is out of bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains code that exhibits this error, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs when trying to access an array element using an index that is greater than or equal to the array's size. This results in undefined behavior, which can lead to crashes or unexpected output. The solution demonstrates how to prevent this error by using proper array index checking.
